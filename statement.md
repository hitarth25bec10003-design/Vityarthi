Problem Statement

In many educational institutions, evaluating student performance early is difficult because academic results depend on multiple factors such as study hours, attendance, previous scores, family background, and learning habits. Teachers often lack data-driven tools to identify students who may need additional support. Incorrect or delayed identification can lead to poor academic outcomes. This project aims to build a Student Grade Prediction System using Machine Learning to predict students’ final grades based on key performance indicators.

Scope of the Project

The system predicts the final grade of a student using input features such as attendance, internal marks, study hours, and past performance.

Provides early warning signals for low-performing students.

Helps teachers and institutes make data-driven decisions.

Includes a simple web application to input student details and obtain predictions.

Provides a trainable ML model that can be extended with more data.

Target Users

Teachers and faculty members who need tools for early performance evaluation.

Educational institutions wanting automated analytics.

Students, to understand where they stand and improve proactively.

Researchers/Students learning about AI/ML applications in education.

High-Level Features

Machine Learning–based prediction using algorithms such as Linear Regression or Random Forest.

Web interface for entering input features.

Visualization of student performance factors (optional).

Easy deployment and GitHub-ready project structure.

Accurate results based on training dataset.

Extendable for multiple subjects or semesters.
