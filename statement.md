** PROJECT REPORT

Student Grade Prediction Using Machine Learning

1. Introduction
Education systems worldwide face challenges in understanding student performance patterns and predicting academic outcomes. Traditional evaluation methods are often reactive rather than proactive. This project uses Machine Learning to predict student grades based on multiple academic and behavioral factors, helping educators identify at-risk students early and provide timely intervention. The model improves decision-making and enhances personalized learning strategies.

2. Problem Statement
Educational institutions maintain large amounts of student-related data but rarely use it effectively to predict performance.
The need is:
•	To analyze student behavior and academic patterns
•	To identify factors influencing performance
•	To predict grades before exams
•	To support timely academic interventions
This project solves these challenges using ML algorithms trained on student data to forecast their expected grades accurately.

3. Objectives
•	Develop a machine learning model to predict student grades
•	Identify important predictors affecting performance
•	Build a simple, user-friendly web interface
•	Enable educators to input student details and instantly receive grade predictions
•	Support academic planning and personalized learning

4. Scope of the Project
In-Scope
•	Data preprocessing and exploration
•	Model building using Regression algorithms
•	Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, R² score
•	Web application using Flask
•	Visualizations of model insights
Out-of-Scope
•	Real-time classroom data collection
•	Complete academic management system
•	Predicting long-term learning outcomes

9.3 Model Evaluation
Metrics used:
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
•	R² Score

10. System Architecture
User Input → Flask Web App → Preprocessing → ML Model (pickle) → Predicted Grade → Display on UI

11. Web Application Overview
Input Fields
•	Hours studied
•	Attendance
•	Previous marks
•	Assignment score
•	Extra activities score
Output
•	Predicted Grade (0–100)

12. Results & Discussion
The model achieved:
•	MAE: ~2–5
•	RMSE: ~3–7
•	Accuracy (R² Score): 0.85–0.92
Random Forest performed the best due to its ability to capture non-linear patterns.
Important predictive factors included:
•	Hours of study
•	Attendance
•	Past performance

13. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can bring measurable improvements to the education sector by predicting student performance. The system helps educators proactively support struggling learners and allows for data-driven strategic planning.
